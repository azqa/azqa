I am a Ph.D. candidate and Lecturer in the [Cyber Analytics Lab](https://cyber-analytics.nl/) (Cyber Security group) at 
[Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/), advised by 
[Dr. Sicco Verwer](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/cybersecurity/people/sicco-verwer) and [Dr. George Smaragdakis](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/cybersecurity/people/george-smaragdakis). 

My research focus is on <b class="main-name">Explainable Machine Learning for Cyber Security</b>. 
I truly believe that machine learning can provide more insights than just prediction probabilities. To this aim, I develop 
*explainable sequential machine learning pipelines* that extract actionable 
intelligence from large volumes of cyber data with the aim of assisting security analysts in their daily operations. 
These pipelines create human in the loop settings for AI-assisted humans.

Next to research, I spend 40% of my time developing and teaching Cyber Security lectures to BSc. (Computer Science and Engineering) students at TU Delft. 
The teaching material can be found under [Cyber Security Lecture Series](https://azqanadeem.github.io/teaching/).

Outside of work, I love landscape photography and traveling. I enjoy discussions about human psychology, 
devious behavior, cats, imposter syndrome, and... well... cats.
