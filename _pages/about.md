I am a lecturer in the [Semantics, Cybersecurity and Services (SCS) group](https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/scs/) at 
[University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/).
My research focuses on <b class="main-name">Explainable Machine Learning for Cyber Security</b>. 
My mission is to go beyond prediction probabilities, and extract semantically meaningful insights from 
machine learning models (especially under unsupervised settings with complex structured data). 


Before joining UT, I was a PhD candidate/lecturer at TU Delft. 
During my PhD, I developed several *explainable sequential machine learning tool-chains* for automating cyber threat intelligence generation.
These tool-chains extracted behavioral insights from large volumes of cyber data in order to assist security analysts in understanding adversary behavior. 

Next to research, I also spent 40% of my time developing and teaching cyber security lectures to BSc. (Computer Science and Engineering) students at TU Delft.
I wrote about my teaching experience [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07625), 
and the teaching material can be found under [Cyber Security Lecture Series](https://azqanadeem.github.io/teaching/). 


Outside of work, I love photography, painting, and traveling. I enjoy discussions about human psychology, 
devious behavior, cats, imposter syndrome, and... well... cats.
