I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Cyber Analytics Lab](https://cyber-analytics.nl/) at Delft University of Technology's [Cyber Security group](https://www.tudelft.nl/cybersecurity/), advised by [Dr. Sicco Verwer](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/s.e.verwer/). 

My research lies at the intersection of <b class="main-name">Machine Learning and Cyber Securtiy</b>. I want to demystify machine learning for security analysts. To this aim, I develop *explainable sequential machine learning pipelines to analyze network attacks*.

Next to research, I teach introductory Cyber Security to BSc. (Computer Science and Engineering) students. The teaching material can be found under [Cyber Security Lecture Series](https://azqa.github.io/teaching/).

Outside of work, I love landscape photography and traveling. I enjoy discussions about human psychology, devious behavior, cats, imposter syndrome, and... well... cats.
