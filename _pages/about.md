I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Cyber Security group](https://www.tudelft.nl/cybersecurity/) at Delft University of Technology. I work at the [Cyber Analytics Lab](https://cyber-analytics.nl/) under the supervision of [Dr. ir. Sicco Verwer](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/s.e.verwer/). My research lies at the intersection of Machine Learning and Cyber Securtiy. Specifically, I develop explainable sequential machine learning pipelines to analyze network attacks.

In addition to my research, I teach Cyber Security topics to B.Sc. (Computer Science and Engineering) students. The lecture slides can be found under [Cyber Security Lecture Series]().

When I'm not working, you will find me traveling, and polishing my photography skills. I love having discussions about human psychology, devious behavior, cats, imposter syndrome, and... well... cats.
