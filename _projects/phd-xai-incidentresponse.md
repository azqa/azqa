**Description:**

<em>Are you interested in interpretable machine learning for cybersecurity, and want to empower security practitioners 
by improving the current state of cyber incident response? The Semantics, Cybersecurity, and Services (SCS) group at the University of Twente 
and the Twente University Centre for Cybersecurity Research (TUCCR) 
invites applications for a fully funded PhD Position in Explainable Incident Response.</em>



In recent years, machine learning (ML) solutions are increasingly being deployed in Security Operations Centers (SOCs) to enhance 
security coverage, and to reduce the number of missed attacks. Not only do these ML systems create many false positives, 
it is often very difficult to understand how they work in the first place {% cite nadeem2023sok %}. Moreover, the forensic analysis of incidents and incident 
response are largely manual procedures, leading to analyst burnout and 'alert fatigue'. 


The objective of this PhD project is to create 'AI-assisted practitioners' for incident response by developing novel ML algorithms 
that reduce analyst workload and provide decision-making assistance {% cite nadeem2021sage3 %}. We propose to develop explainable ML algorithms that 
summarize large volumes of observable data (intrusion alerts, network & system logs) in order to discover contextually meaningful patterns from them. 
The student will explore multi-modal learning and generative AI to produce actionable explanations from these discovered patterns 
that are tailored to the operator's expertise. 


The evaluation of these algorithms will be done under closed-world and open-world settings. For the closed-world setting, a major challenge 
is the lack of suitable datasets to evaluate ML models {% cite rimmer2021open %}. The student will set up a testbed together with our industry collaborators 
for the collection of intrusion alert datasets. For the open-world setting, the student will deploy these algorithms in real SOC environments 
in order to measure the extent of workload reduction experienced by security analysts. In doing so, we aim to develop technologies that are not 
only novel but also have real-world applications. 

The PhD student will be embedded within the Semantics, Cybersecurity, and Services (SCS) group at University of Twente. 
The student will have the opportunity to participate in internships and/or collaboration with industry partners under the TUCCR initiative. 
The SCS group offers a stimulating, supportive, and diverse research environment, as well as plenty of opportunities for personal and professional growth.

**Your profile:**

- You are a highly motivated and enthusiastic researcher, aspiring to do world-class research and have real-world impact. 
- You have a MSc degree with excellent grades in computer science, or similar; Applications from students who are about to finish their MSc degree studies will be considered as well. 
- You are interested in the domain of cybersecurity and have a solid background in systems security and/or data science/artificial intelligence; Some industrial experience in a cybersecurity role and prior experience with writing scientific papers are of additional advantage. 
- You know your way around UNIX/Linux systems and can code in Python. 
- You are curious and interested in learning how things work and how to make them better. 
- You have a creative mind-set and excellent analytical and communication skills. 
- You have good team spirit and like to work in an interdisciplinary and internationally oriented environment. 
- You are proficient in English.

**Our offer:**

- As a PhD candidate at UT, you will be appointed to a full-time position for four years, with a qualifier in the first year, within a very stimulating and exciting scientific environment.
- The University offers a dynamic ecosystem with enthusiastic colleagues.
- Your salary and associated conditions are in accordance with the collective labour agreement for Dutch universities (CAO-NU).
- There are excellent benefits including a holiday allowance of 8% of the gross annual salary, an end-of-year bonus of 8.3%, and a solid pension scheme.
- The flexibility to work (partially) from home. 
- A minimum of 232 leave hours in case of full-time employment based on a formal workweek of 38 hours. A full-time employment in practice means 40 hours a week, therefore resulting in 96 extra leave hours on an annual basis. 
- Free access to sports facilities on campus. 
- A family-friendly institution that offers parental leave (both paid and unpaid). 
- You will have a training programme as part of the Twente Graduate School where you and your supervisors will determine a plan for a suitable education and supervision. 
- We encourage a high degree of responsibility and independence, while collaborating with close colleagues, researchers and other staff.


**About University of Twente:**

The mission of the Semantics, Cybersecurity, and Services (SCS) group within the faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) 
is to advance the development of 
innovative online services with improved quality through context-alignment, and with reduced security and privacy threats. SCS is part of the 
Twente University Centre for Cybersecurity Research (TUCCR), a public-private partnership where experts, 
professionals, entrepreneurs, researchers, and students from industry and knowledge partners collaborate to deliver talents, 
innovations, and know-how in the domain of cybersecurity. The mission of TUCCR is to strengthen the security and digital 
sovereignty of our society by performing top-level research on real-world data, systems, and network security challenges. 
TUCCRâ€™s founding partners are Betaalvereniging Nederland, BetterBe, Cisco, NCSC, NDIX, Northwave, SIDN, SURF, Thales, 
TNO, and the University of Twente.

The University of Twente connects technology, science, and engineering with social sciences. Established in 1961, 
it has since evolved into a leading hub for multidisciplinary research and education, hosting over 16,500 UT staff -- students and academics.
At UT, we work together to find groundbreaking solutions, at the forefront of technology and the digital revolution. Our research and education 
reaches beyond the campus. We push boundaries and join forces with relevant partners. We do this, for example, within the cooperation of the 
four technical universities in the 
Netherlands (4TU.Federation) and with the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, with whom we offer a growing number of bachelor's programmes. 
This attracts ambitious people from all over the world. With students from 85 different countries studying in one of our 16 bachelor's or 30 master's programmes, 
our community is diverse and international. Our campus, designed to encourage interaction, spans over 146 hectares and boasts modern amenities, 
sports facilities, and cultural events.
