**Description:**

In this project, we aim to systematize the state-of-the-art literature that uses explainable artifical intellignece (XAI) for security applications 
in order to consolidate the notion of explainability within cybersecurity, i.e., in terms of key stakeholders (explanation users), 
application objectives (explanation uses), task domains, and preferred explanation methods.
